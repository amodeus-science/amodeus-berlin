AMoDeus is currently in a refactoring phase until end of May. If you want to test the Open Berlin Scenario + AMoDeus, 
you can follow these steps for the time being:

- Clone this repository and put it in Eclipse/IntelliJ
- Clone `amodeus-science/amodeus` next to it
- Go to the `5.5.x` of the (Open Berlin Scenario)[https://github.com/matsim-scenarios/matsim-berlin]
- Download `matsim-berlin/scenarios/berlin-v5.5-1pct/input/berlin-v5.5-1pct.config.xml` and put it in the cloned `amodeus-berlin` directory
- Start `RunBerlinWithAmodeus` or `RunBerlinWithAmodeusInDrt` from the `amodeus-berlin` project in Eclipse
